# Storage Pricing Matrix

  ## Overview

   - This project was inspired by my dad's constant complaints about his phone storage being full. I thought of how Google Cloud Storage offers scalable storage solutions and decided to create a simple web-based storage plan selector. The interface adjusts its layout based on the device using CSS media queries and Flexbox, providing an optimal user experience.

  ## Features
     
   - Displays three storage plans: Basic, Standard, and Premium.

   - Responsive design using CSS Flexbox and media queries.

   - Details include pricing, storage capacity, number of users, and support options.

   - Clean and user-friendly interface.

  ## Technologies Used

    - HTML: For the structure of the webpage.

    - CSS: For styling, including Flexbox for layout and media queries for responsiveness.

    - Git: For version control to manage project changes.

  ## Installation

   - Clone the repository:
            git clone <repository-url>

   - Navigate to the project directory:
            cd STORAGE PRICING MATRIX

   - Open index.html in a web browser to view the project.

  ## Usage

   - Open the webpage on different devices or resize the browser window to see the responsive design in  action.

   - Review the storage plans and their features to choose the best fit.

  ## Future Improvements

     - Add interactivity with JavaScript to allow plan selection.

     - Enhance the design with animations or additional styling.

     - Integrate a backend to simulate a subscription process.
